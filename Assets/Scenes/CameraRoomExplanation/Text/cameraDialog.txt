In the next level, you'll go to the camera room.
This is the last and most important level of the game.
You'll have to lay still while the doctors take big photos with their big camera.
To play, put the sandbags on the sides of the bed.
And then put the straps across the bed.
The doctors will do the same, but don't be afraid! They're there to keep you nice and steady.
Then the fun part comes! The doctors will take photos with a reeeeally big camera.
Don't be afraid of the big camera. It's there to help them out.
It's got two parts. Slide them on top of each other and pull the bed in between them.
