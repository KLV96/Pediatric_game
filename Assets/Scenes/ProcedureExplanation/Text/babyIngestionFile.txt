Before you can get your scan today, you must drink all the milk a nurse or doctor will give you. This is important for your scan to work. 
Here's a simple game that shows you what happens. Keep tapping the bottle to take sips from it. You can also tap some bubbles that will appear!
To progress to the next stage, you must empty the bottle. Good Luck!
